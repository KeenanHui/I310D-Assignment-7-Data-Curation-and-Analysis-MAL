Scraping top 300 anime on My Anime List using pandas
Using Python's panda API, I look at data from My Anime List and found the top 300 anime, sorting it by the following categories:
Rank, Anime name, Anime type, Number of episodes, Start air date, End air date, number of members who watched the anime, and the score.
In the code, two different methods were used to clean the data, although only one is used.
After cleaning the data, I created and analyzed a bar chart looking at the number of episodes an anime has and its rank.
